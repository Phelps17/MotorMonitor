# IoT Based Motor Monitoring and Preventative Maintenance

## Summary
For system components that are hard to directly monitor, you can utilize a proxy. In this case, using the status of electric motors as an indicator of the health of parts theyâ€™re connected to, we are able to demonstrate the possibility of proxy monitoring as a means of detecting problems before they occur. 

Live collecting sensor data is stored in a round robin database aboard each sensor module, attached to your system component. When desired, the Android application can fetch the sensor data from modules, analyze it, and create visualizations for users. Sensor data can be cross compared with established baseline data from properly functioning systems, or from other deployed sensor modules. Analytics can be performed to detect sensor data irregularities, which can then be used as system health indicators.
